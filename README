DESCRIPTION
===========
The application is designed for SoC containing USB host controller Fujitsu USB 2.0
under control of ARM1176jzf-s CPU. Most of the code is borrowed from U-boot bootloader
(commit 227b72515546fca535dbd3274f6d875d97f494fe).

Application does the following:
1. Initializes EHCI subsystem
2. Performs FAKE initialization of OHCI subsystem (remember, this is only a test)
3. Scans for a device on port 0
4. Repeats all from the beginning
