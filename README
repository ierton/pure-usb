DESCRIPTION
===========
This software is a test for SoC containing USB host controller Fujitsu USB 2.0
IP-core and arm1176jzf-s CPU. No operation system is used to prevent possible
influence on test results. Most of the code was borrowed from U-boot bootloader
(commit 227b72515546fca535dbd3274f6d875d97f494fe).

Currently, the application does the following:
- Initializes EHCI subsystem
- Performs FAKE initialization of OHCI subsystem (remember, this is only a test)
- Scans for a device on port 0
- Repeats all from the beginning
